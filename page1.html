<h1>AWS Solution Architect – Practice Test (Page 1)</h1>

<!-- ================= Q1 ================= -->
<div class="question">
<pre>
1) A company needs to architect a hybrid DNS solution. This solution will use an Amazon Route 53 private hosted zone for the domain cloud.example.com for the resources stored within VPCs.
The company has the following DNS resolution requirements:
On-premises systems should be able to resolve and connect to cloud.example.com.
All VPCs should be able to resolve cloud.example.com.
There is already an AWS Direct Connect connection between the on-premises corporate network and AWS Transit Gateway.
Which architecture should the company use to meet these requirements with the HIGHEST performance?
</pre>

<div class="options">
<label><input type="radio" name="q1">A. Associate the private hosted zone to all the VPCs. Create a Route 53 inbound resolver in the shared services VPC.

<label><input type="radio" name="q1">D. Associate the private hosted zone to the shared services VPC. Create a Route 53 inbound resolver in the shared services VPC. Attach the shared services VPC to the transit gateway and create forwarding rules in the on-premises DNS server for cloud.example.com that point to the inbound resolver.</label>
</div>

<button onclick="showAnswer(this,[0])">Show Answer</button>
<div class="explanation">
<b>Correct Answer: A</b><br><br>
Route 53 inbound resolvers are AWS-managed, highly available, and horizontally scalable.
They are designed specifically for hybrid DNS resolution from on-premises to AWS.
Associating the private hosted zone with all VPCs ensures native DNS resolution across AWS,
and inbound resolvers allow on-premises systems to resolve private AWS DNS names over Direct Connect
without EC2-based DNS forwarders, giving the highest performance.

2) A company is providing weather data over a REST-based API to several customers. 
The API is hosted by Amazon API Gateway and is integrated with different AWS Lambda functions for each API operation. 
The company uses Amazon Route 53 for DNS and has created a resource record of weather.example.com. 
The company stores data for the API in Amazon DynamoDB tables. The company needs a solution that will give the API the ability to fail over to a different AWS Region.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
</pre>

<div class="options">
<label><input type="radio" name="q2">A. Deploy a new set of Lambda functions in a new Region. Update the API Gateway API to use an edge-optimized API endpoint with Lambda functions from both Regions as targets. Convert the DynamoDB tables to global tables.</label>

</div>

<button onclick="showAnswer(this,[2])">Show Answer</button>
<div class="explanation">
<b>Correct Answer: C</b><br><br>
Route 53 failover routing with health checks provides deterministic and automatic regional failover.
When the primary API becomes unhealthy, traffic is routed to the secondary Region.
DynamoDB global tables ensure that the API data is replicated and available in both Regions.

3) A company uses AWS Organizations with a single OU named Production to manage multiple accounts. All accounts are members of the Production OU. Administrators use deny list SCPs in the root of the organization to manage access to restricted services.
The company recently acquired a new business unit and invited the new unit’s existing AWS account to the organization. Once onboarded, the administrators of the new business unit discovered that they are not able to update existing AWS Config rules to meet the company’s policies.
Which option will allow administrators to make changes and continue to enforce the current policies without introducing additional long-term maintenance?
</pre>

<div class="options">
<label><input type="radio" name="q3">A. Remove the organization’s root SCPs that limit access to AWS Config. Create AWS Service Catalog products for the company’s standard AWS Config rules and deploy them throughout the organization, including the new account.</label>

5) A company uses a service to collect metadata from applications that the company hosts on premises. Consumer devices such as TVs and internet radios access the applications. 
Many older devices do not support certain HTTP headers and exhibit errors when these headers are present in responses. 
The company has configured an on-premises load balancer to remove the unsupported headers from responses sent to older devices, which the company identified by the User-Agent headers.
The company wants to migrate the service to AWS, adopt serverless technologies, and retain the ability to support the older devices. 
The company has already migrated the applications into a set of AWS Lambda functions.

7) A company is running a traditional web application on Amazon EC2 instances. The company needs to refactor the application as microservices that run on containers. 
Separate versions of the application exist in two distinct environments: production and testing. 
Load for the application is variable, but the minimum load and the maximum load are known. 
A solutions architect needs to design the updated application with a serverless architecture that minimizes operational complexity.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

8) A company has a multi-tier web application that runs on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). 
The instances are in an Auto Scaling group. The ALB and the Auto Scaling group are replicated in a backup AWS Region. 
The minimum value and the maximum value for the Auto Scaling group are set to zero. 
An Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB instance stores the application’s data. The DB instance has a read replica in the backup Region. 
The application presents an endpoint to end users by using an Amazon Route 53 record.
The company needs to reduce its RTO to less than 15 minutes by giving the application the ability to automatically fail over to the backup Region. 
The company does not have a large enough budget for an active-active strategy.
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

10) A retail company is operating its ecommerce application on AWS. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). 
The company uses an Amazon RDS DB instance as the database backend. Amazon CloudFront is configured with one origin that points to the ALB. Static content is cached. 
Amazon Route 53 is used to host all public zones.
After an update of the application, the ALB occasionally returns a 502 status code (Bad Gateway) error. 
The root cause is malformed HTTP headers that are returned to the ALB. 
The webpage returns successfully when a solutions architect reloads the webpage immediately after the error occurs.
